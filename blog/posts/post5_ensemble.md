# Post 5: The Ensemble - When 1+1 = 3 (Regime Switching in Action)

**Series:** Building a Production RL Trading System
**Part 5 of 6**

---

## The Ensemble Hypothesis

After six models and countless experiments, the evidence was overwhelming:

**Best performances by regime:**
- Q1 2025 bull market: v1 returned 12.95% (+7.18 pp vs EW)
- Q3 2025 correction: v2 returned +0.34% (+3.52 pp vs EW, only model positive!)

**The simple math:**
```
If we use v1 in Q1:  +12.95%
If we use v2 in Q3:  +0.34%
Combined YTD:        ~13% (estimated)

vs. v1 alone:        10.10% YTD
Expected gain:       +2-3 pp improvement
```

**The hypothesis:** Instead of trying to build one model that works everywhere, build specialist models and switch between them based on market regime.

October 4, 2025. Time to build it.

## The Architecture: Three Components

The ensemble needed three things:

1. **RegimeDetector** - Identify current market condition (bull/bear/neutral)
2. **EnsembleManager** - Load models, select which one to use
3. **Switching Logic** - Decide when to change models (with hysteresis to prevent whipsaw)

Let me show you how each piece works.

### Component 1: RegimeDetector

**The question:** How do you algorithmically determine if the market is in a bull or bear regime?

I tested several approaches and settled on a multi-indicator system:

```python
class RegimeDetector:
    def __init__(
        self,
        drawdown_threshold=-0.10,      # -10% triggers bear
        volatility_threshold=0.025,    # 2.5% vol triggers bear
        consecutive_loss_threshold=5,   # 5 losing days triggers bear
        hysteresis_days=3,             # 3-day confirmation
        volatility_window=10,          # 10-day vol calculation
        trend_window=20                # 20-day trend
    ):
        self.drawdown_threshold = drawdown_threshold
        self.volatility_threshold = volatility_threshold
        self.consecutive_loss_threshold = consecutive_loss_threshold
        self.hysteresis_days = hysteresis_days
        self.volatility_window = volatility_window
        self.trend_window = trend_window

        # State tracking
        self.current_regime = "bull"
        self.regime_history = []
        self.regime_candidate = None
        self.regime_candidate_days = 0

    def detect_regime(self, portfolio_returns):
        """
        Detect market regime using multiple signals
        Returns: ('bull' | 'bear' | 'neutral', info_dict)
        """
        # Calculate indicators
        drawdown = self._calculate_drawdown(portfolio_returns)
        volatility = self._calculate_volatility(portfolio_returns)
        consecutive_losses = self._count_consecutive_losses(portfolio_returns)

        # Determine raw regime (before hysteresis)
        raw_regime = "bull"

        # Bear signals
        if (drawdown < self.drawdown_threshold or
            volatility > self.volatility_threshold or
            consecutive_losses >= self.consecutive_loss_threshold):
            raw_regime = "bear"

        # Bull signals (stricter criteria)
        elif all([
            drawdown > -0.05,          # Shallow drawdown
            volatility < 0.015,        # Low volatility
            consecutive_losses < 2     # Few losses
        ]):
            raw_regime = "bull"
        else:
            raw_regime = "neutral"

        # Apply hysteresis to prevent whipsaw
        confirmed_regime = self._apply_hysteresis(raw_regime)

        info = {
            'drawdown': drawdown,
            'volatility': volatility,
            'consecutive_losses': consecutive_losses,
            'raw_regime': raw_regime,
            'confirmed_regime': confirmed_regime
        }

        return confirmed_regime, info
```

**Key design decisions:**

1. **Multiple indicators** - Don't rely on just drawdown or volatility. Use all three.
2. **Asymmetric thresholds** - Easier to trigger bear (defensive bias) than bull
3. **Hysteresis** - Require 3 consecutive days of new regime before switching
4. **State tracking** - Remember regime history for analysis

### Component 2: EnsembleManager

The manager loads both models and selects actions based on regime:

```python
class EnsembleManager:
    def __init__(self, v1_model_path, v2_model_path, regime_config):
        # Load specialist models
        self.v1_model = self._load_model(v1_model_path)  # Momentum
        self.v2_model = self._load_model(v2_model_path)  # Defensive

        # Initialize regime detector
        self.regime_detector = RegimeDetector(**regime_config)

        # Performance tracking
        self.returns_history = []
        self.regime_history = []
        self.switch_log = []

    def get_action(self, observation, portfolio_returns):
        """
        Select model based on regime and get action
        """
        # Detect current regime
        regime, info = self.regime_detector.detect_regime(portfolio_returns)

        # Select appropriate model
        if regime == "bear":
            action = self.v2_model.predict(observation)[0]
            active_model = "v2"
        else:  # bull or neutral
            action = self.v1_model.predict(observation)[0]
            active_model = "v1"

        # Log switch if regime changed
        if len(self.regime_history) > 0:
            if regime != self.regime_history[-1]:
                self.switch_log.append({
                    'date': len(portfolio_returns),
                    'from': self.regime_history[-1],
                    'to': regime,
                    'reason': info
                })

        # Track state
        self.regime_history.append(regime)

        return action, active_model, regime, info

    def _load_model(self, model_path):
        """Load SAC model with VecNormalize"""
        model = SAC.load(f"{model_path}/final_model.zip")
        env = VecNormalize.load(f"{model_path}/vec_normalize.pkl", DummyVecEnv([lambda: None]))
        model.set_env(env)
        return model
```

**Key features:**

1. **Model isolation** - Each specialist loaded independently
2. **Regime-based selection** - Simple if/else based on regime detector
3. **Switch logging** - Track every regime change for analysis
4. **State tracking** - Full history for backtesting and debugging

### Component 3: Backtesting Framework

To validate the ensemble, I built a backtesting system:

```python
def backtest_ensemble(
    v1_model_path,
    v2_model_path,
    data,
    regime_config,
    start_date,
    end_date
):
    """
    Backtest ensemble strategy on historical data
    """
    # Initialize ensemble
    ensemble = EnsembleManager(v1_model_path, v2_model_path, regime_config)

    # Initialize portfolio
    portfolio_value = 100000
    portfolio_returns = []
    daily_values = []

    # Run simulation
    for date, observation in data.items():
        if date < start_date or date > end_date:
            continue

        # Get action from ensemble
        action, active_model, regime, info = ensemble.get_action(
            observation,
            portfolio_returns
        )

        # Execute action (rebalance portfolio)
        new_value, daily_return = execute_trade(
            portfolio_value,
            action,
            observation['prices'],
            transaction_cost=0.001
        )

        # Track performance
        portfolio_value = new_value
        portfolio_returns.append(daily_return)
        daily_values.append({
            'date': date,
            'value': portfolio_value,
            'return': daily_return,
            'model': active_model,
            'regime': regime,
            **info
        })

    # Calculate metrics
    total_return = (portfolio_value - 100000) / 100000
    sharpe_ratio = calculate_sharpe(portfolio_returns)

    return {
        'total_return': total_return,
        'sharpe_ratio': sharpe_ratio,
        'daily_values': daily_values,
        'switches': ensemble.switch_log
    }
```

## The Configuration

I set up the baseline ensemble with these parameters:

```yaml
# config/ensemble_baseline.yaml
regime_detection:
  drawdown_threshold: -0.10        # -10% DD → bear
  volatility_threshold: 0.025      # 2.5% vol → bear
  consecutive_loss_threshold: 5     # 5 losses → bear
  hysteresis_days: 3               # 3-day confirmation

models:
  v1_path: "production/models/v1_20251003_131020"
  v2_path: "production/models/v2_defensive_20251003_212109"

backtesting:
  start_date: "2025-01-01"
  end_date: "2025-09-26"
  transaction_cost: 0.001
```

**Hysteresis explanation:**
- If market shows bear signals for 3 consecutive days → switch to v2
- If market shows bull signals for 3 consecutive days → switch to v1
- Prevents daily whipsawing between models

## Initial Results: The Baseline Ensemble

**Backtesting 2025 YTD (Jan-Sep, 186 days):**

```
Total Return: 12.90%
vs Equal Weight: +3.52 pp ✅
vs v1 alone: +2.80 pp ✅
vs v2 alone: +6.73 pp ✅

Sharpe Ratio: 0.930
Max Drawdown: -8.77%
Regime Switches: 8 times
v1 Usage: 82.7% of days
v2 Usage: 17.3% of days

Status: SUCCESS ✅
```

**Holy shit, it worked!**

12.90% YTD, beating v1 (10.10%) by 2.80 pp. The ensemble hypothesis was validated.

### Q1 2025 Analysis: Perfect Execution

| Metric | Value | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Return | 12.95% | Identical to v1 |
| vs EW | +7.15 pp | Dominant |
| Regime | Bull (100%) | v1 active entire quarter |
| Switches | 0 | No regime changes |
| Sharpe | 2.413 | Excellent |

**Perfect.** The ensemble recognized Q1 as a strong bull market and kept v1 active the entire time. Same 12.95% return as v1 alone.

### Q3 2025 Analysis: The Problem Emerges

| Metric | Value | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Return | -4.86% | Not good |
| vs EW | **-1.71 pp** ❌ | **Below baseline** |
| Regime switches | 6 times | Too many |
| v2 Usage | 38.7% | Defensive mode |
| Sharpe | -1.106 | Poor |

**Wait... what?**

The ensemble underperformed equal weight in Q3 by -1.71 pp. How did this happen? We have v2, the only model that was positive in Q3 (+0.34%).

### The Whipsaw Problem

Let me show you the Q3 regime switches:

```
Q3 2025 (62 trading days):

Day 1-8:    Bull regime → v1 active
Day 9-15:   Bear regime → v2 active (switch #1)
Day 16-22:  Bull regime → v1 active (switch #2)
Day 23-31:  Bear regime → v2 active (switch #3)
Day 32-38:  Bull regime → v1 active (switch #4)
Day 39-47:  Bear regime → v2 active (switch #5)
Day 48-62:  Bull regime → v1 active (switch #6)

Total switches: 6
Average regime duration: 10 days
```

**The problem:** Q3 was choppy. The market oscillated between mild drawdowns (triggering v2) and brief recoveries (triggering v1). We switched models every 10 days on average.

**Every switch = transaction costs + potential timing errors.**

Example whipsaw sequence:
1. Market drops 5% → switch to v2 (defensive)
2. Market recovers 3% → switch to v1 (aggressive)
3. Market drops 4% again → switch to v2
4. Each switch: 0.1% transaction cost + potentially wrong timing

**Result:** -4.86% Q3 return, below EW by -1.71 pp.

## The Ensemble vs. Specialists: Complete Comparison

Let me show you the full picture:

### 2025 YTD Performance

| Strategy | Return | Sharpe | Switches | Decision |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Ensemble (baseline)** | **12.90%** | 0.930 | 8 | ✅ Best overall |
| v1 (Momentum) | 10.10% | 0.738 | 0 | ✅ In ensemble |
| v2.1 (Balanced) | 9.87% | 0.748 | 0 | ⚠️ Backup |
| Equal Weight | 9.29% | 0.882 | 0 | 📊 Baseline |
| v2 (Defensive) | 6.17% | 0.504 | 0 | ✅ In ensemble |

### Quarterly Breakdown

**Q1 Bull Market:**

| Strategy | Return | vs EW | Regime |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Ensemble | 12.95% | +7.15 pp | v1 (100%) |
| v1 | 12.95% | +7.15 pp | — |
| v2.1 | 11.02% | +5.25 pp | — |
| EW | 5.76% | — | — |

**Q3 Correction:**

| Strategy | Return | vs EW | Regime |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| v2 | **+0.34%** | +3.52 pp ✅ | — |
| EW | -3.17% | — | — |
| **Ensemble** | **-4.86%** | **-1.71 pp** ❌ | Mixed (6 switches) |
| v1 | -6.81% | -3.64 pp | — |

**The Q3 problem is clear:** The ensemble's 6 switches caused whipsaw losses. Pure v2 would've returned +0.34%, but the ensemble switching degraded performance to -4.86%.

## The Key Insight: Asymmetric Hysteresis

After analyzing the whipsaw problem, I had an idea:

**"What if regime switches aren't symmetric?"**

Current logic (3-day hysteresis for both):
- Bull → Bear: 3 days confirmation
- Bear → Bull: 3 days confirmation

**New idea (asymmetric hysteresis):**
- Bull → Bear: 3 days confirmation (quick to protect)
- Bear → Bull: 7 days confirmation (slow to re-risk)

**The rationale:**

1. **Enter defensive quickly** - When correction signals appear, protect capital immediately (3-day confirmation)
2. **Exit defensive slowly** - When correction seems over, wait to ensure it's real (7-day confirmation)
3. **Prevent premature re-risking** - Choppy markets often have brief rallies during corrections

This is called "Sticky BEAR" - easy to enter bear regime, hard to exit.

```python
# Asymmetric hysteresis implementation
def _apply_hysteresis(self, raw_regime):
    # Determine hysteresis window based on transition
    if raw_regime == "bear":
        hysteresis_days = self.hysteresis_days  # 3 days
    elif self.current_regime == "bear":
        # Exiting bear regime: use longer window
        hysteresis_days = self.bear_exit_hysteresis_days  # 7 days
    else:
        hysteresis_days = self.hysteresis_days  # 3 days

    # Apply hysteresis
    if raw_regime != self.current_regime:
        if self.regime_candidate == raw_regime:
            self.regime_candidate_days += 1
            if self.regime_candidate_days >= hysteresis_days:
                self.current_regime = raw_regime
                self.regime_candidate = None
                self.regime_candidate_days = 0
        else:
            self.regime_candidate = raw_regime
            self.regime_candidate_days = 1

    return self.current_regime
```

## Testing Sticky BEAR

I tested three configurations:

| Config | Bear Entry | Bear Exit | Description |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Baseline | 3 days | 3 days | Symmetric |
| 5-day Sticky | 3 days | 5 days | Moderate asymmetry |
| 7-day Sticky | 3 days | 7 days | Strong asymmetry |

**The results were stunning—but I'll save that for Post 6.**

Spoiler: The 7-day Sticky BEAR configuration turned Q3's -4.86% into **+0.73%**, a +5.58 pp improvement!

## What We Learned About Ensemble Design

### 1. **Regime Detection is Hard**

Simple drawdown + volatility + losses works, but:
- Need multiple indicators (no single metric is enough)
- Need hysteresis (prevent daily whipsawing)
- Need asymmetry (enter defense fast, exit defense slow)

### 2. **Transaction Costs Matter**

6 regime switches in 62 days = significant cost:
- 0.1% per switch
- 6 switches = 0.6% drag on Q3 performance
- Reducing switches is critical

### 3. **Timing is Everything**

Switching from v2 (defensive) back to v1 (aggressive) too early during a choppy correction:
- Miss v2's protective stance
- Re-enter risk during continued volatility
- Get whipsawed by market noise

### 4. **The Ensemble > Best Single Model**

Despite Q3 whipsaw issues:
- Ensemble YTD: 12.90%
- Best single model (v1): 10.10%
- Improvement: +2.80 pp

Even with imperfect switching, the ensemble won.

## Code: Putting It All Together

Here's the production ensemble code:

```python
# Initialize ensemble
ensemble = EnsembleManager(
    v1_model_path="production/models/v1_20251003_131020",
    v2_model_path="production/models/v2_defensive_20251003_212109",
    regime_config={
        'drawdown_threshold': -0.10,
        'volatility_threshold': 0.025,
        'consecutive_loss_threshold': 5,
        'hysteresis_days': 3,
        'bear_exit_hysteresis_days': 7  # Sticky BEAR
    }
)

# Trading loop
for date, market_data in trading_days.items():
    # Get observation
    observation = prepare_observation(market_data)

    # Get action from ensemble
    action, active_model, regime, info = ensemble.get_action(
        observation,
        portfolio.returns_history
    )

    # Execute trade
    portfolio.rebalance(action, market_data['prices'])

    # Log
    print(f"{date}: Regime={regime}, Model={active_model}, "
          f"Return={portfolio.daily_return:.2%}")
```

## Performance Summary

**Baseline Ensemble (3-day symmetric):**
- 2025 YTD: 12.90%
- Q1: 12.95% (perfect, matched v1)
- Q3: -4.86% (whipsaw problem)
- Switches: 8 total (6 in Q3 alone)

**The success:** Beat v1 (10.10%) by 2.80 pp overall

**The problem:** Q3 whipsaw cost -1.71 pp vs EW

**The solution:** Sticky BEAR (7-day asymmetric hysteresis)

1. ✅ **Ensemble > single model** - 12.90% vs 10.10% (+2.80 pp)
2. ⚠️ **Whipsaw is real** - 6 Q3 switches degraded performance
3. ✅ **Asymmetric hysteresis needed** - Easy into bear, hard out of bear
4. ✅ **Transaction costs matter** - Every switch = 0.1% drag

**The Numbers:**

| Period | Ensemble | v1 | v2 | Winner |
|--------|----------|----|----|--------|
| Q1 | 12.95% | 12.95% | 3.21% | Ensemble = v1 ✅ |
| Q3 | -4.86% | -6.81% | +0.34% | v2 wins ⚠️ |
| YTD | **12.90%** | 10.10% | 6.17% | **Ensemble** ✅ |
