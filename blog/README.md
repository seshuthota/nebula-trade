## üéØ Writing Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Technical but accessible
- Honest about failures
- Show real code, real data
- No cherry-picking results

**Structure per post:**
1. **Hook** - Grab attention with problem/question
2. **Context** - What we tried
3. **Results** - What happened
4. **Analysis** - Why it happened
5. **Lessons** - What we learned

**Code snippets:**
- Show actual production code
- Highlight "aha moments"
- Explain design decisions
