## 📦 Archive Contents

The `archive/` directory contains 118 files organized as:

```
archive/
├── old_scripts/           # 14 deprecated scripts
│   ├── training/         # 7 training scripts
│   ├── evaluation/       # 3 evaluation scripts
│   ├── tests/           # 3 test scripts
│   └── utilities/       # 1 utility script
│
├── old_docs/             # 17 old documentation files
│
└── old_results/          # 48MB of old experiment results
    └── results/          # 6 old experiment folders
```

**How to Access Archived Files:**
- Old training scripts: `archive/old_scripts/training/`
- Old documentation: `archive/old_docs/`
- Old results: `archive/old_results/`

---

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### On Next Training Run

These directories will be **automatically regenerated**:
- `wandb/` - WandB logging (if enabled)
- `tensorboard_logs/` - Tensorboard logs (if used)
- `__pycache__/` - Python cache
- `logs/` - Training logs

They're in `.gitignore` so they won't clutter git anymore.

### If You Need Old Files

All old files are preserved in `archive/`:
```bash
# View old training scripts
ls archive/old_scripts/training/

# View old documentation
ls archive/old_docs/

# Access old results
ls archive/old_results/
```

## 🎓 Key Decisions Made

### Why Archive Instead of Delete?

1. **Safety First** - Can always recover if needed
2. **Reference** - May want to compare implementations
3. **History** - Preserves the project's evolution
4. **Git-Friendly** - Still in git history if needed

### What We Kept

- ✅ Essential documentation (4 files)
- ✅ Data pipeline utility (run_pipeline.py)
- ✅ All trained models
- ✅ docs/ and blog/ (as requested)
- ✅ All configuration files
- ✅ New unified system

### What We Removed

- ❌ Generated logs (1.15GB)
- ❌ Python cache (auto-generated)
- ❌ Old experiment results (archived, not deleted)
